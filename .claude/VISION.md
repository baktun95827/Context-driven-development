# PROJECT VISION: "The Effortless Creator"

## 1. The Mission

To build a web application that allows non-technical users to create and launch beautiful, simple one-page websites in under five minutes. The experience should feel magical, not technical.

## 2. Core User Journeys

- **The "30-Second Draft":** A user answers 3 simple questions and immediately sees a professionally designed, populated website draft.
- **The "Intuitive Edit":** Editing text and images on the page feels as simple as writing an email. What you see is what you get.
- **The "One-Click Launch":** A user can deploy their site to a live URL with a single, unambiguous button press.

## 3. Guiding Principles

- **Simplicity Above All:** If a feature requires a settings panel or a complex configuration, it's a sign that we have failed in our design. Reject complexity.
- **Performance is Invisible Infrastructure:** The app and the final websites must load almost instantly. A slow experience is a broken experience.
- **Empowerment, Not Overwhelm:** We give users beautiful, curated choices, not infinite options.

## 4. What This Is NOT

- It is **NOT** a full-featured website builder like WordPress, Webflow, or Squarespace.
- It is **NOT** for creating multi-page sites or e-commerce stores.
- It is **NOT** a tool for developers.
